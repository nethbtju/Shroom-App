<h1>Welcome to Shroom!</h1>

This right here is my first attempt at making a mobile application on Swift using XCode and Firebase. (It's a work in progress!)

Shroom is a gamified to do list catering to university students like myself who have trouble managing a heavy workload during the semester. 
You get to pick your starting shroom and complete activities under a set timer to gain points for your shroom. 
Remember, once you start the activity, you must complete it to gain the points!

The UX is a bit janky, but i'm quite proud of the UI I have put together using hand drawn characters and pixel art!
